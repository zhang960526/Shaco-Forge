# Shaco Forge Context Handover

## Project

Shaco Forge is a Windows Desktop Agent product built on a pinned DeepSeek Harness baseline.

## Current Version Goal

V1.0 = Harness Desktop Baseline using Electron Desktop + independent per-user long-running Worker.

## Key Decisions

- Worker is Runtime Authority.
- Desktop is Client/Projection/Native Shell.
- Reuse Harness Client↔Host contract; no second full Agent RPC.
- Named Pipe is a candidate Shaco physical carrier and must be proven in P0.S.
- Worker is a Harness Host via documented profile/bundle/launcher seams.
- Full third-party plugin parity is not a V1.0 requirement.
- Harness upgrades are pinned + compatibility-tested + backed up + fail-closed.
- Harness data down-migration is not promised.
- Minimal Shaco Control Store exists for product/control-plane metadata.
- Future 1.1 Automation domain is Shaco-owned.
- Future 1.2 may use Worker-owned Codex/Claude/ACP/SDK child processes.

## Current Status

P0/P0.S/P0.5 design has been audited and is ready with corrections incorporated. P0 execution is next. P1 cannot freeze until P0.S passes.
